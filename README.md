<h1>Peer-to-Peer Chat Application</h1>
<p>The application contains two executables: a server and a client.</p>

<br />The client takes part in peer-to-peer communication.</p>

<h2>How to Use:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Start the server executable on a system</li>
  <li>On each peer, run the client executable, passing in the IP of the system running the server as an argument</li>
  <li>Messages typed and sent on a peer will appear for all other peers</li>
</ol>
